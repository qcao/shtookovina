# How to Define Missing Language?

Create new file, its name should consist of two-letter code of new language
(see [ISO 639-2](http://www.loc.gov/standards/iso639-2/php/code_list.php))
and `.lisp` suffix.

Files from this folder are loaded on start of Шτookωвiнα to set target
language (language that user wishes to learn). Every such a file contains
invocation of `set-language` function. Here is description of the function:

```
set-language name lexemes
```

This function generates and sets language for learning. Such a form must be
evaluated before any exercises take place. `name` is a string — name of the
language. `lexemes` is a list where every element is of form `(keyword
l-name &rest params)`, where `keyword` is keyword for internal use and
`l-name` is name of lexeme (string). This lexeme will have «self-sufficient
forms» that supplied with `:ss-forms` key argument (in `params`), all others
forms will be generated by concatenation of all possible combinations of
«form aspects» as supplied with `:form-aspects` keyword. However, order of
«form aspects» will be preserved.

It's important to note that you shouldn't include those forms of verbs (and
other parts of speech in some languages) if they can be constructed somehow
from known elements (or using uniform rules). See definitions of other
languages for reference.
